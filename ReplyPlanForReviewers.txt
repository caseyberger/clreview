Overall remarks on referees' comments:\
\
R1: Certainly positive. Has only "a few pretty minor remarks". Just wants more information.\
\
R2: Certainly undecided. Likes the idea but thinks the execution needs to either be improved substantially or be less ambitious.\

Title: Complex Langevin and other approaches to the sign problem in\
      quantum many-body physics\
Authors: C. E. Berger et al.\
\
This is a very well written report. It nicely summarizes\
recent approaches to sign problem in numerical simulations\
of quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum many-body physics.\
The main focus is on the Complex Langevin (CL) method, and\
recent applications to non-relativistic many-body systems.\
The manuscript is suitable for publication in Physics Reports.\
\
I have a few pretty minor remarks, which are summarized\
below:\
\
1) The main result from the authors own work is a calculation\
of the equation of state of a spin-polarized unitary Fermi gas.\
This is very interesting work, because this is clearly more than\
just a toy problem, and the authors are in a position to make\
a contribution to an ongoing experimental effort.\
\
In this context it would have been useful to provide a little\
more information about what is known theoretically and experimentally,\
and whether the authors can make contact or compare with this\
information. \
\
First of all, shouldn't the system have a first order phase\
transition? There is some experimental work on the location of\
that transition, for example by the MIT group (Y. Shin, A. Schirotzek,\
C.H. Schunck, and W. Ketterle, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 070404 (2008)),\
and some work on the equation of state (Navon, N. et al., The Equation\
of State of a Low-Temperature Fermi Gas with Tunable Interactions,\
Science 328.5979 (2010)), although the experiments may indeed be\
mostly about low T.\
\
>> [ R1 Q1a: Improve discussion on experimental background ]\
\
\
There is extensive theoretical work on the nature of the phase\
diagram, for example Radzihovsky, Leo, and Daniel E Sheehy, Imbalanced\
Feshbach-Resonant Fermi Gases, Reports on Progress in Physics 73.7 (2010),\
076501, and some very accurate theory and experiment on the polaron\
problem.\
\
>> [ R1 Q1b: Improve discussion on theoretical background ]\
\
\
\
2) The authors briefly mention that most CL simulations are carried\
out with purely real noise, but do not provide any explanation or\
intuition why this is expected to be the best choice.\
\
>> [ R1 Q2: Improve discussion on why it is a good idea to use real noise ]\
\
\
\
3) Toy problem 2 is a real integral in which CL is applied by\
rewriting the real action in terms of a complex action. But\
obviously I could have applied CL by adding complex noise to the\
original action, or rewriting the action in some other way. Again,\
is there any intuition why the complex action is "better" than\
complex noise?\
\
>> [ R1 Q3: Is there anything here beyond empirical observation? ]\
\
\
\
4) The authors very briefly mention the relation between CL and the\
Lefschetz thimble decomposition. This seems like an interesting\
question, and it would obviously be good if one could say a little\
bit more. \

Reviewer #2: As expressed in the title the main goal of this review to\
present a discussion of applications of complex stochastic\
quantization to quantum many-body problems. This indeed is the\
main theme of discussion in sections 2 and 3 of the report,\
which is well structured and can be followed "step by step".\
\
In addition the authors also try to provide a discussion of\
"other approaches to the sign problem" in section 2 as well\
as "applications of the Complex Langevin approach in fields \
out side the quantum many-body context", in particular in the \
context of quantum field theories. I find these parts of the\
report at various places too "sketchy". Certainly at many\
places these discussions are not self-contained, often do not\
allow to extract from the presentation more than a list of\
references. For instance in section 2.7 two approaches to \
the sign problem in QCD are mentioned -- simulations at imaginary \
chemical potential and Taylor series expansions. The former\
approach is mentioned by pointing to a few references and a\
figure (Fig. 6(left)). Neither in the text nor in the figure caption\
it is explained what is shown in this figure. The same holds\
true for the middle and right hand figure, which refers to a\
1-d fermion model. Neither the observable shown nor the model\
itself is discussed anywhere in the text. Similarly the use\
of Taylor expansions is mentioned without any details (but \
with a comment in a bracket, which is not related to any discussion\
of the method given in the text). In this case I also find the \
three references related to the Taylor expansion method rather\
"arbitrary".\
\
>> [ R2 Q1: Certainly true that some sections are very brief. Identify those (e.g. Sec. 2.7) and try to balance.]\
\
\
Similar problems I have with the presentation of the Complex Langevin\
approach in QFT's in section 4. Here the largest part of the discussion\
is actually spend in section 4.1 on "QCD inspired models", which are of\
little help when trying to find solutions to the sign problem in a\
QFT like QCD. Some QCD results are shown in Fig.12, but why?. The \
figures are not discussed in the text and the reader will not be able to \
extract any information from this figure. The notion of HQCD is  not discussed\
in the QCD section 4.2 but as a side remark in section 4.1, which deals\
with the xy-model. The topic "non-equilibrium QFT" appears in the title\
but is not discussed in this section. In fact, there only seems to be \
a short paragraph with two references in section 3 that mentions \
non-equilibrium physics.\
\
>> [ R2 Q2a: Explain whatever is going on in the figures shown in Sec. 4.1, as needed.]\
\
>> [ R2 Q2b: Fix the problem with HQCD.]\
\
>> [ R2 Q2c: Perhaps remove non-equilibrium parts altogether?]\
\
\
To conclude: The backbone of this review -- Complex Langevin approach\
in many-body physics -- is presented well and the reader can extract practical\
information. However, I feel uncomfortable with the discussion of \
"other approaches" and "applications in QFT's", which do not seem to \
serve a concrete purpose. The reader may hardly extract more from it then\
a list of references.\
